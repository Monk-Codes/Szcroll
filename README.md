## About The Project
![Screenshot (22)](https://github.com/Monk-Codes/Szcroll/assets/84877191/2c91e31a-e530-492b-ae6c-98f5f4c93bd8)

Levitate is a meditation page with soothing audio embeded on every mode.
Sit and Relax your Body & Soul with Buddha

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

 So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
